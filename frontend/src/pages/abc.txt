Unique Keys: When rendering lists, provide a unique key to each item to help React efficiently update the DOM.

Event Handling: React elements have event handlers like onClick={(event) => ...}. These events are synthetic, meaning they wrap native browser events for cross-browser compatibility.

Complex Logic: Move complex logic into separate functions or variables for better readability and maintainability.

useState Hook: useState is used to manage state in functional components. Initialize with a default value, e.g., useState(-1) for invalid or empty initial states.

State vs. Variables: Variables not managed by state will reset on re-render. Use useState to persist values across renders.

useState Syntax: useState returns an array:

Example:

Props: Props are inputs passed to components, similar to function arguments. They are immutable. Example:

onSelectItem: A property or function passed as a prop to handle item selection. It can be implemented inline or as a separate function.

Dynamic Class Names: Use conditional logic to apply classes dynamically. Example:

State Updates on Click: Update state dynamically using event handlers. Example:

Parent-Child Communication: Use functions like onSelectItem() to notify the parent component about changes in the child component.

Props vs. State:

Props: Inputs passed to a component, immutable, similar to function arguments.
State: Data managed within a component, mutable, similar to local variables.
Children Prop: Used to pass dynamic content from parent to child components. Example:

Empty State Handling: Use conditional rendering to handle empty states. Example:

Reusable Components: Design components to be reusable by passing props like items, heading, and event handlers.

Fragments: Use <Fragment> or shorthand <>...</> to group multiple elements without adding extra nodes to the DOM.

Best Practices:

Keep components small and focused.
Use props for data that doesn't change and state for data that does.
Use unique keys for list items.
Separate logic from JSX for better readability.
